     * Usually AngularJS Material structure of a toolbar places the first button right below the element with the class "md-toolbar-tools",
     * and places a negative left margin on the first button. In our structure the button is wrapped into other HTML elements and thus looses
     * its negative margin, marking the first element of the toolbar further away.
     * This is corrected by applying the same margin on the first wrapped button.
